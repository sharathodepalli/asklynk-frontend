## üîß Required Production Changes

### 1. Environment Configuration System

Create environment-aware configuration:

```javascript
// config.js (NEW FILE NEEDED)
const CONFIG = {
  development: {
    API_BASE_URL: "http://localhost:3000",
    AUTH_PAGE_URL: "http://localhost:5173",
  },
  production: {
    API_BASE_URL: "https://api.asklynk.com", // UPDATE WITH YOUR DOMAIN
    AUTH_PAGE_URL: "https://app.asklynk.com", // UPDATE WITH YOUR DOMAIN
  },
};

const ENV = chrome.runtime.getManifest().version_name || "production";
export const API_BASE_URL =
  CONFIG[ENV]?.API_BASE_URL || CONFIG.production.API_BASE_URL;
```

### 2. Production Manifest Updates

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "AskLynk - AI-Powered Classroom Assistant",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Transform your classroom with AI-powered anonymous questions, smart transcription, and context-aware assistance",
  "permissions": ["storage", "activeTab"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://api.asklynk.com/*",
    "https://app.asklynk.com/*"
  ],
  "externally_connectable": {
    "matches": ["https://app.asklynk.com/*"]
  }
}
```

### 3. Console Logging Strategy

```javascript
// utils/logger.js (NEW FILE NEEDED)
const Logger = {
  isDevelopment: chrome.runtime.getManifest().version_name === "development",

  log(...args) {
    if (this.isDevelopment) console.log(...args);
  },

  error(...args) {
    console.error(...args); // Always log errors
  },

  warn(...args) {
    if (this.isDevelopment) console.warn(...args);
  },
};
```
