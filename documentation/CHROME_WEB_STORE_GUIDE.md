API_BASE_URL: 'https://your-actual-backend-domain.com', // Replace with real backend URL
```

### Step 2: Run Production Build

# Execute the production build script
./build-production.sh
```

This script will:

- Use production manifest with correct permissions
- Force production environment configuration
- Create `asklynk-extension-v1.0.0.zip` for Chrome Web Store upload

### Step 3: Verify Production Build
